% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.


% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
The parallelized calculation of PI ($\pi$) has been chosen to compare different parallel computing technologies by benchmarking the same algorithm running at the same machines. Thus a short program has been written meeting the special requirements of the technologies. Notably these technologies are the MPICH2 implementation of the message passing interface (MPI), the Threads library from the new C++11 standard and OpenMP API from the OpenMP consortium.\\
All these standards allow inter process/thread communication which is a crucial requirement to parallelize tasks on modern multi core computer systems. Though all technologies use different approaches.\\  
The MPI is a standardized communication protocol which applies the concept of message passing to communicate between processes. They may be running on the same or on different systems connected by a network. In comparison to the other technologies briefly introduced below, it works on processes and not on threads. The MPI implementation MPIChameleon 2 (MPICH2) released by the Argonne National Laboratory has been used for the benchmarks in this paper \cite{anl}.\\
The latest version of the C++ standard C++11 released in late 2011 supports parallelization by multithreaded programming. The C++11 standard library provides a thread class which takes a function object to start a new thread. The concept for inter thread communication is synchronization. In order to compile the PI calculation program the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) tool chain has been set up \cite{cpp11}.\\%Add a source
The third used technology is the OpenMP API. It makes it possible to parallelize threads by preprocessor directives. The trusted communication concept for the threads is to use shared memory. The same random access memory (RAM) area can be accessed by different threads at the same time \cite{omp}.\\

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically

% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.

\section{Methods}
As benchmarking systems Linux x64 Ubuntu 12.04 boxes with two Xeon E5504 CPUs were chosen. Each CPU has four cores and the hyper-threading technology (HT) allows a maximum of 16 threads per machine. Since MPI provides a interconnection via Ethernet this limitation does not apply for it. The GCC was used in version 4.6.3, the MPICH2 environment in version 1.4.1 and the OpenMP tool chain in version 3.1.\\
The PI calculation algorithm was taken form Argonne National Laboratory and was adapted to the C++ Threads and the OpenMP environment. PI is the mathematical constant to describe the relation between a circle's circumference and its diameter. If the diameter is $1$ then the circumference is $\pi$. The keynote for calculation is to approximate with polygons to the circle. Depending on the number of rectangles the calculated result is more accurate.\\
To achieve meaningful measurement results the number of rectangles was set to $100,000,000$ and $1,000,000,000$ while the number of threads/processes grew by a factor of $p = 2$ $P = \{1,2,4,8,16,32,64\}$. Each setting was measured three times and concluding the average was taken as result. For the MPICH2 benchmark four machines as described above were used. The next section discusses the empirical results of the benchmarks.\\%sources

\section{Empirical Results}
The obtained empirical benchmark results for $1,000,000,000$ rectangles with $P$ threads/processes are shown in figure \ref{img:ex0a}.\\

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{graphics/ex0a.png}
	\caption{Benchmark result for 1,000,000,000 rectangles.}
	\label{img:ex0a}
\end{figure}

The y-axis plots the run time in seconds, the x-axis the number of threads/processes. For one thread/process the run time is the same on any platform. For $p$ where $1 < p < 16$ the measured time is almost equal on all platforms. Just the MPI run time is in average between 10 and 20 milliseconds shorter. For $p >= 16$ threads it is for C++11 and OpenMP slightly longer than with just 8 cores. In contrast the MPICH2 could succeed a further speedup with 16 and 32 processes. Certainly the run time becomes longer with 64 processes. The following table gives an overview about the measured fastest run times, listed independent from the number of threads/processes.\\

%Table of shortest run times
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | r | r |}
    \hline
    Technology & Fastest Run & Highest Speedup \\ \hline
    MPI & 0.9263 & 31.42 \\ \hline
    C++11 & 3.6920 & 7.98 \\ \hline
    OpenMP & 3.6443 & 7.98 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
	\label{tab:runtimes}
\end{center}

The results for $1 \cdot 10^{8}$ are almost the same but divided by $10$ which follows from the number of rectangles $(1 \cdot 10^{9} \div 10)$. Therefore these results are not discussed any further.\\

%Speedup diagram
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{graphics/ex0b.png}
	\caption{Speedup for 1,000,000,000 rectangles.}
	\label{img:ex0b}
\end{figure}

As shown in figure \ref{img:ex0b} the highest speedup $S(p)$ can be achieved with the MPI technology. C++11 and OpenMP reaching their maximum of a $S(p) = 7.98$ with $8$ threads, where MPI's maximum is $S(p) = 31.42$ with $32$ processes.\\

%Efficiency diagram
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{graphics/ex0c.png}
	\caption{Efficiency for the values from figure \ref{img:ex0c}.}
	\label{img:ex0c}
\end{figure}

Following the results from the speedup (figure \ref{img:ex0b}) we receive the efficiency graphs in figure \ref{img:ex0c}. Looking closer on the values for 8 threads the efficiency $E(p)$ converges to $1$ with all technologies. The graph even shows values above $E(p) = 1$ because of the smoothing and not because of a measurement imprecision. In order to Amdahl's law there can't be an efficiency $E(p)\ \leq\ 1$.
Based on the presented empirical results the next section draws a conclusion.\\

\section{Conclusion}
The run time of C++11 and OpenMP speeds up until it reaches the hardware limitation of the computer systems. Due to the fact they are running on a single machine with a maximum of 16 parallel threads/processes the highest expected speedup would be achieved with 15 cores. One core would stay reserved for system management operations. Because the measured number of threads always increased by a factor of $2$ the maximum speedup with 8 threads is ($S(p) = 7.98$) with an efficiency $E(p)\ \approx\ 1$. Thus both, speedup and efficiency drop for a further growing $p$.\\
This limitation is not valid for the MPI technology because it uses more machines for the calculation. As described above a single system has a maximum of 16 parallel threads/processes. In order of the four used machines we expected a maximum speedup with $(4 \cdot 16) - 4$ because of the run time any machine needs for its system operations. The empirical results have shown that. The speedup grows until it reaches the maximum of $S(p) = 31.42$ with 32 processes. For 64 processes it decreases again. The efficiency converges against $1$ until 64 processes are used.\\
A further improvement on the one machine platforms could be achieved with more hardware cores. A further speedup with MPI could be realised by using more systems for the calculation.\\
